### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jorjaosburn/jorjaosburn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi! I'm Jorja. ğŸ¦– I'm a Digital Game Design student at Southwest Career and Technical Academy and I really enjoy making 3d models (especially dinosaurs).
My interests in game development are to make any sort of horror game, I used to really be into making games on roblox but I wanted to expand a little more and try to develop games outside of roblox studio since the program is very limited. 
I don't have anything in particular that I would like to explore, and I am very open to just creating anything as long as it is interesting.
